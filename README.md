# TwitterUserGenderIdentification

With the growth of social media in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the automatic characterisation of users based on the informal content they generate. Gender recognition is essential and critical for many applications in the commercial domains. Imagine that Twitter needs to push advertisements based on gender. As there are many fake accounts or accounts belonging to organisations, Twitter cannot rely on what the users themselves mention in their respective profile descriptions. Hence, Twitter would need to determine the gender of the profile based on user behaviour on the platform.

To enable this, need to train an algorithm to determine if a Twitter account belongs to a man or a woman or an organization. Need to build two models based on two different classification algorithms and compare the results.
